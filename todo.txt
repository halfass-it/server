=> Horizontal Scaling:
For horizontal scaling in Python, you can use a process manager like Supervisor or a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. These tools allow you to run multiple instances of your Python server and automatically scale them up or down based on the load.
With Supervisor, you can create a configuration file to manage multiple processes and set autoscaling rules based on system metrics.
For Kubernetes, you can define your Python server as a Deployment resource and use the replicas field to specify the number of instances. Kubernetes will automatically manage the desired state and scale instances as needed.

=> Caching Layer with Memcached:
You can use the Python python-memcached library to interact with Memcached from your Python application. Here's an example of setting and getting a value in Memcached:
import memcache
# Connect to Memcached
mc = memcache.Client(['127.0.0.1:11211'])
# Set a value
mc.set('key', 'value')
# Get a value
value = mc.get('key')
/utils

=> Monitoring with a Free Local Software:
For monitoring, you can use a tool like Glances, which is a cross-platform system monitoring tool written in Python. It provides real-time system information and can be run locally on your servers.
/bot

=> Backup for PostgreSQL:
For backing up your PostgreSQL database, you can use the built-in pg_dump utility or a tool like pg_backup. Here's an example of using pg_dump to create a backup:
pg_dump -U postgres -d mydatabase > backup.sql
You can automate this process using cron jobs or a backup management tool like PostgreSQL Backup and Restore (pbr).
/auth_server
/gameplay_server


=> Content Delivery Network (CDN):
For serving static assets through a CDN, you can use a CDN service provider like Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, or Fastly. These services allow you to cache and distribute your static content globally for better performance and reduced latency.
Alternatively, you can self-host a CDN using a tool like Nginx, Apache Traffic Server, or Varnish Cache.
Here's an example of configuring NGINX to serve static assets:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location /static/ {
        root /path/to/static/files;
        expires 30d;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
/router
